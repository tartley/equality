0.1.1   Fixes glaring timezone bug.
        Fix faulty tests that handled timezones the wrong way around.
        Delete a whole bunch of my own buggy code,
        replaced with two lines of calls to library 'pendulum'.

0.1.0   Ostensibly now takes account of timezones,
        but actually has a huge bug wherein it does it all wrong.

0.0.39  Works but totally ignores timezones, assumes all timestamps
        are tz naive.

...

0.0.1   Unstable experimental releases, mostly testing my 'release
        to PyPI' script.
