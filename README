equality
========

Utilities to aid in testing for equality.

Help with failing asserts like

    assert actual == {
        'id': 123,
        'field1': 1,
        ...
    }

Where 'id' is generated by the database and is different every test run.
Fix this using 'AnyInt':

    assert actual == {
        'id': AnyInt(),
        'field1': 1,
        ...
    }

Instances of AnyInt compare equal to any integer. So this assertion will
now pass if and only if the value of the 'id' field is an int.

There are other classes for use in other situations.

Dependencies
------------

Written on Python 2.7 (sorry),
but it's a bug if it doesn't work on 3 as well.

Install
-------

::

    pip install equality

Plans
-----

Slowly add occasional new classes as the need arises.

Known Problems
--------------

It's hot of the presses, so is doubtless full of mistakes.

Alternatives
------------

This doubtless duplicates better work elsewhere. Let me know and I'll
happily delete this project.

Thanks
------

To all the good folks formerly of Resolver Systems.
